# FMCG-Data-analysis With Azure

•Project Development : Developed a optimized solution for the FMCG domain, enabling the ingestion of large-
scale data from on-premise SQL databases into ADLS using Azure Data Factory ,achieving a 40% improvement
in data accessibility .
• Data Ingestion & Integration : Configured Self-hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR) on local servers
to establish secure connections between on-premise systems and Azure, ensuring smooth data transfer from
on-premise SQL Server to ADLS.
• Azure Data Factory Configuration : Created Linked Services and Datasets in Azure Data Factory to
automate the data pipeline processes, ensuring seamless data movement from source systems to the data lake.
• Secrets Management : Implemented security best practices by storing credentials and sensitive information
in Azure Key Vault and dynamically fetching them in data pipeline configurations, ensuring secure access
management.
• Data Transformation & Analytics with Azure Databricks : Utilized Azure Databricks for advanced
data processing, leveraging Apache Spark to clean, transform, and aggregate large datasets for analysis,
improving data quality and enabling efficient analytics workflows.
